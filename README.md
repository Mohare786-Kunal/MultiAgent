## Overview

This project provides a unified interface to interact with multiple services using natural language. When a user sends a command (e.g., "Create a private repository named 'test' with README"), the platform uses Groclake's ModelLake to convert the command into a structured JSON instruction. Depending on the instruction, the appropriate agent (e.g., GitHub Agent, Gmail Agent, Photos Agent) executes the corresponding operation using each service's API.

The core idea is to use Agents' capabilities to:
- **Parse natural language commands.**
- **Augment generation with retrieval context** (via VectorLake and DataLake if needed).
- **Execute operations** across multiple services.

## Features

- **Natural Language Command Processing:** Uses Groclakeâ€™s ModelLake to interpret user commands.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Leverages VectorLake and DataLake to provide relevant context when generating responses.
- **Multi-Service Support:** Initially includes a GitHub agent and is designed to support other agents such as Gmail, Photos, and more.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new agents to support additional applications.

## Architecture

The platform is built around three main Groclake components:

- **Agent Classes:** Each agent (e.g., `GitHubAgent`) implements the logic to execute specific operations by interfacing with the relevant API.

The Flask web server exposes a REST endpoint (`/agent`) that receives JSON payloads (with a `"query_text"` field) and routes them to the appropriate agent handler.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-groclake.git
   cd multi-agent-groclake
